					<h6>2016: UNSPOKEN</h6>
					<hr class="redline">
					<p class="imagine">Last March 13, 2016, TEDxADMU launched their fourth and latest installment at the Newport Performing Arts Theatre in Resorts World Manila with an audience of over 1,400 people, making TEDxADMU 2016 the biggest TEDx event held in the Philippines yet.

					</p>
					<p class="low">
						  
						The theme for TEDxADMU 2016 was The Questions We Have To Ask. For as long as we can remember, we have been part of a society: a society we interact with and traverse each and every day. A society that is deviant and diverse from the next, a society where certain issues are left unexamined and unquestioned. The time has come for humanity’s existence, beliefs, and norms––amidst the issues in its society––to be challenged. Last TEDxADMU, the team has invited everyone to delve into a deeper sense of humanity and the stigmas that are associated with it.</p>

					<h6>2015: WHY-COORDINATE</h6>
					<hr class="redline">
					<p class="imagine">
					“It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied into a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one destiny, affects all indirectly.”
					</p>
					<p class="imagine">

					― Martin Luther King Jr.
					</p>
					<p class="low">
						  
						TEDxADMU’s third annual event held last February 21, 2015 at the Irwin Lee Theatre, focused on how the collective “we” can benefit society. It aimed to emphasize the intrinsic connection of people with one another, and how together, we can aim towards community and nation-building, and actually make a difference.

					<h6>2014: PROJECTi</h6>
					<hr class="redline">
					<p class="imagine">
					A journey of self-introspection put together by the youth geared towards mobilizing the same generation - the youth, the change-makers and the future. Are we simply the so-called "selfie" generation, or is there more?
					</p>
					<p class="low">
						Themed “Project I,” TEDxADMU’s second installment emphasized on how the self, even as a work in progress, has the power to engage minds and create meaningful change in the community. Held on December 14, 2013, the “I” was revealed as both a projection of the self to the world, and as a project that is challenged to take a journey of self-introspection in order to grow.
					</p>
					<p class="low">
						  
						But who is the "I"? From Building the Nation, it aims to take a step back in order to move forward and look into building the self

					<h6>2013: IgNation</h6>
					<hr class="redline">
					<p class="imagine">
					"Hindi nag-uumpisa ang iyong mga pangarap kapag matanda ka na. Nag-uumpisa iyan ngayon." - Sabrina Ongkiko
					</p>
					<p class="low">
						TEDxADMU’s first ever event was held back in January 12, 2013, in the Henry Lee Irwin Theater. The event garnered around 500 attendees. IgNation particularly focused on nation building, and how every single act we do can benefit the greater good. Participants were given the opportunity to light a fire, ignite the nation, to plant a seed, and grow the nation, and through this talk, they were able to find dedication.
