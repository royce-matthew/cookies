						as a species, haven't had one day off

						  
						in 27 million years.

						  
						So you'll just work us to death?

						  
						We'll sure try.

						  
						Wow! That blew my mind!
					</p>
					<p class="low">
						  
						"What's the difference?"
						How can you say that?

						  
						One job forever?
						That's an insane choice to have to make.

						  
						I'm relieved. Now we only have
						to make one decision in life.

						  
						But, Adam, how could they
						never have told us that?

						  
						Why would you question anything?
						We're bees.</p>

						According to all known laws

						Its wings are too small to get
