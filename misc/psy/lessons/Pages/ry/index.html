              <p style="padding:50px;">it is the unique way in which each individual thinks, acts, and feels throughout life. Two components of personality are character, which refers to value judgments made about a person’s morals or ethical behavior and temperament, or the enduring characteristics a person is born with. Four perspectives regarding personality include the psychoanalytic, behaviorist, humanistic, and trait perspectives.</p>

        According to the behaviorists’ perspective, personality consists of a set of learned responses or habits. A variation on the behaviorist perspective is that of the social cognitive learning theorists, who emphasize the role of conditioning along with an individual’s thought processes in the development of personality. A strong proponent of the social cognitive view, Albert Bandura, suggested that the environment, behavior, and personal/cognitive factors all act together to determine an individual’s actions in a process Bandura referred to as reciprocal determinism. An important component of the cognitive factors is the person’s sense of self-efficacy, or perception of how effective a behavior will be in a particular context. Julian Rotter proposed that individuals develop a relatively set way of responding and this behavior represented “personality.” An important determinant of the individual’s response was his or her sense of locus of control. According to Rotter, the individual’s expectancy and the response’s reinforcement value were the two key factors that determined how an individual would react.
The humanistic perspective of personality focuses more on qualities that are considered uniquely human such as free will and subjective emotions. Carl Rogers proposed that humans are always striving to fulfill their innate capacities in a process known as the self-actualizing tendency. Rogers defined positive regard as warmth, affection, love, and respect that comes from significant others. In order for an individual to work toward self-actualization, they need to be exposed to a certain level of unconditional positive regard from the significant others in their lives. Rogers felt that conditional positive regard would restrict a person’s ability to become a fully functioning person. Rogers believed an individual’s image of oneself, or self-concept, also played a role in becoming fully functional. The self- concept was based on what an individual is told by others and also his or her own sense of self. According to Rogers, self-concept could be divided into a real self and an ideal self. If the real self and ideal self concept were too far apart, anxiety and neurotic behavior would result.
