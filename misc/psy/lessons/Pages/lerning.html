          <p class="value-description">In his classic paradigm, Pavlov used dogs as research subjects. Dogs like to eat meat, and when they are exposed to meat, they salivate. The salivation is a reflex, or an involuntary response that is not under personal choice or control.

Edward Tolman studied the phenomenon of latent learning in rats placed in a maze but not reinforced for finding their way out. He found that when the rats were subsequently reinforced, learning occurred much faster than for rats that had never been in the maze. </p>

         Observational learning, or the learning of a new behavior by observing someone else who is performing that behavior. The term learning/performance distinction describes the fact that learning can take place without actual performance.
